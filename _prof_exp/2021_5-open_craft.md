I trialed at OpenCraft.
During this time, I (among other things):
* [added support for developing an internal application using Docker;](https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft/pull/795)
* [upstreamed a fix for a grading bug in Open edX;](https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft/pull/795)
* upstreamed a feature in Open edX comprising [frontend](https://github.com/edx/frontend-app-course-authoring/pull/126) and [backend](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/27825);
* [documented known issues and fixes/workarounds for running tools in Apple Silicon](https://forum.opencraft.com/t/apple-silicon-compatibility/951?u=joao.cabrita);
* ran a discovery on how to optimize setting up databases for new Open edX instances.
