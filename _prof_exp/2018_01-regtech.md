This project's main focus was modernizing the company's applications and delivery processes.
It also included ensuring GDPR compliance and preparing for security certification.

I worked remotely for this project, as part of a team of 6 people.

My contributions included:
* designing much of the standard automated delivery process;
* implementing several micro-services for integrating with third-party services;
* implementing a new, major service for case management.
