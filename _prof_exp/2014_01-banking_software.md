This project revolved around modernizing much of the company's outdated software infrastructure,
specifically in terms of application front-end development and delivery practices.

I helped design and create a framework prototype for front-end development,
using Servlet-based Java for the server-side and Javascript (angular.js) on the client-side.
I also implemented most of the Continuous Integration infrastructure for developing, testing,
and deploying a sample application using the framework described above, using Ansible and XLDeploy.
