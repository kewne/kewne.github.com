My first professional experience was at Deloitte, working part-time on a Java Web-based Customer Relationship Management application as part of a team of three people.
The internship provided me with lots of learning opportunities on the basics of application development and business in general.
My main contributions to the project during this time were on the technical level, specifically bug fixing.

After six months as an intern, Deloitte hired me to work full-time for them on the same project.
My time in this position allowed me to further my learning in application development and also my soft skills, since I became involved with feature development and had to deal with our users, mostly to do requirements' analysis and present prototypes.
Besides fixing some more bugs, I developed parts of the billing module, in particular the provisions' related features.

Towards the end of my colaboration with Deloitte, I was responsible for the development of REST webservices meant to be consumed by a mobile application being developed by another team, as well as SOAP services to interact with a middleware solution, also being developed by another team.
