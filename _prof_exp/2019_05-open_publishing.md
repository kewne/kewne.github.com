I was the first Open Publishing hire for a newly founded team based in Faro, Portugal.
As a team lead, I was responsible for:
* collaborating on HR matters related to the team (hiring, procuring office space, etc.);
* coaching team members in both technical areas and soft skills;
* being an individual contributor to both technical design and implementation.

I worked remotely for this role in the local team of 3 people,
which was part of a larger team of 10 people, spread across 3 locations.

My contributions included:
* supporting some of the production infrastructure and almost all of the non-production one, including:
  * Elasticsearch clusters;
  * MySQL databases;
  * Docker Swarm Clusters;
  * Secret management and rotation (certificates and passwords);
  * User accounts;
  * Monitoring (Prometheus);
* developing and supporting Python-based services;
* bug fixing in the core C++ application;
* designing and implementing CD pipelines using Gitlab.
