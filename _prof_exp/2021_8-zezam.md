I joined zezam to lead the Backend engineering team (2 people full-time + 2 part-time);
the role involved setting up and evolving the team's processes, notably:
* the implementation of a mostly async communication process,
which gave engineers time to focus on development;
* establishing a weekly sync meeting to organize engineering efforts
across the engineering teams (Frontend and Backend);
* supporting the company's business by estimating feature complexity
and suggesting alternatives or new features based on technical capabilities.

The company worked in fully remote fashion and, during my time there,
pivoted through several business models:
1. providing a white-label, B2B application for managing fitness and welness studios;
2. a B2C SaaS offering of an e-commerce focused link-in-bio;
3. a B2C SaaS offering to make affiliate marketing more accessible for social media influencers.

My most notable technical contributions to the product were:
* an ordering system,
which allowed both payment systems (PayPal and Stripe)
as well as product types to be introduced as plugins;
* a subscription management system,
based on Chargebee;
* an accounting ledger to track
user earnings, as well as the batch processes to ingest
the data from partner APIs.
