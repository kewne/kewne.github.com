We're engineers but sometimes it feels as if we're baseball players: we don't really hit home runs often, and when we do, we come up with weird reasons for why it happened.

Our profession is engineering but, most of the time, it's hard to tell the good practices from the plain superstitions.

We boast our understanding of science but, in reality, we keep engaging in religious and political-like debates over things that probably don't matter that much.

Sometimes, that's alright: at some point, we need to go with our instinct to get things done.
To a degree, we need to feel in control in order to be happy doing what we do.
Most of all, however, I think we need to keep things in perspective.
