title: CompletionStage and CompletableFuture tutorial
---
Just FYI, I've started working on (yet another) tutorial on Java's CompletionStage and CompletableFuture, [check it out!](https://github.com/kewne/completable-future).

The goal is to add executable examples of how some of the trickier parts work and eventually move to patterns using it.
Feel free to give me a shout if you see anything wrong or want to contribute!
