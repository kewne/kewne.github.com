title: Code is not an end
---
The last few years have seen somewhat of a rise of the "Age of the Geek", with software developers and code, the product of their work, gaining visibility and importance.

With this greater visibility, and alongside a growing need to hire for software developers, there came the idea that everyone should learn to code, with some defending the idea that it should be included in elementary schools' curriculum.

While, to some extent, I agree with the idea (software will only play an even bigger part in the world of the future), I also think that it misses the point: _code is a means to an end, not the end itself_.

The same way that learning French does not make you a better communicator or knowing how to use brushes doesn't make you a better painter, learning to code won't make you better at whatever it is you want to do.
Writing software is not easy (as noted by the number of IT projects that fail) and is not for everyone.
If you're not going to write software, you have little business writing code.

Rather, the issue seems to be a lack of understanding of how systems interact.
