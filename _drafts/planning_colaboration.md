Today I'm writing about a particular anti-pattern I've seen teams falling into, which I call the "one person team".

This happens when, despite there being an official team, all of the teammembers are effectively working on separate things, with very little colaboration happening.

## Why it's an anti-pattern

The reason this is an anti-pattern is that the point of having teams is precisely that the nature of work benefits from it;
however, if there is no real teamwork, the quality or quantity of the result will suffer.

### Inferior design

Design is one of those areas where teamwork really produces the best results;
research has concluded that teams tend to produce better solutions to problem and, in particular, more diverse teams tend to produce the best solutions.

It's easy to understand why this happens: even the brightest people fail to foresee every possible outcome so having more people trying to find holes in the design and fixing them leads to a better end design.

### Inconsistent architecture

Architecture becomes a patchwork of different styles because nobody takes a holistic look and instead just wants to solve their problem, their way.

### Weak or non-existent documentation

If you don't have to explain what you're doing to anyone,
you have no reason to write it down, much less in a coherent way.

### Toxic team culture

It's easier to dehumanize people that you don't talk to and, if you're usually working in silos, most interactions are likely to be caused by a conflict that needs to be solved.

### Difficult to plan

The bus factor, what happens when the one person takes days off/gets sick/leaves?

## Why it happens

### Too many things to do

All of downsides are in the future, so when pressure to deliver gets high, it's easy to optimize for the short-term.
