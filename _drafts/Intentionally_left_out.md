# Checklists

I've become a big fan of checklists.
This is something I talked about in [my coding.earth presentation][coding earth presentation]
but might also be the topic of another post.

When filling out a checklist, people will sometimes delete the items that don't apply;
I think this is the wrong thing to do, as someone unfamiliar with the checklist would
look at the result and miss out on the fact that the other person **intentionally**
skipped something.

Instead, my personal preference is to strike-through the items.

# Comments

Something about how comments are sometimes necessary to convey that
you're intentionally *not doing* something.
