## Synchronous meetings are (mostly) a waste of time

Synchronous meetings are basically anything that requires your nearly undivided attention, like:

* an actual physical meeting;
* a Zoom call or similar;
* an instant chat.

The common thing about these is that they optimize for latency, i.e., you get immediate feedback, which means they're great for discussing specific problems that need to be solved sooner rather than later.

Otherwise, they're a pretty poor fit for most of the communication that needs to happen in software development.
