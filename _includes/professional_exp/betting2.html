<p>This project was a continuation of the Italian site project and aimed at evolving the platform to improve the breadth of betting choices for italian customers.</p>
<p>Instead of temporarily relocating to Porto again, I worked remotely most of the time and travelled there every fortnight for planning and other meetings.</p>
<p>I also made [my first contribution](https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/pull/651) to an open-source project in this scope.</p>
