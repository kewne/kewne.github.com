            After a year with Coreworks, I decided to go back into consulting and moved to agap2.

        <p>
            I've been assigned to a project with a client in Porto which does web development.
            Since, at the time of writing this, I've only been here for a week, I don't have a lot to say yet.
            The people are all very nice and the project seems to be both interesting and challenging.
            Updates on this to come!
