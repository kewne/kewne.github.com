<p>My first professional experience was at Deloitte, working part-time on a Java Web-based Customer Relationship Management application as part of a team of three people.
The internship provided me with lots of learning opportunities on the basics of application development and business in general.</p>
<p>My main contributions to the project during this time were on the technical level, specifically bug fixing.</p>
<p>After six months as an intern, Deloitte hired me to work full-time for them on the same project.
My time in this position allowed me to further my learning in application development and also my soft skills, since I became involved with feature development and had to deal with our users, mostly to do requirements' analysis and present prototypes.</p>
<p>Besides fixing some more bugs, I developed parts of the billing module, in particular the provisions' related features.
Towards the end of my colaboration with Deloitte, I was responsible for the development of REST webservices meant to be consumed by a mobile application being developed by another team, as well as SOAP services to interact with a middleware solution, also being developed by another team.</p>
