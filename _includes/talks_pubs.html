        <p>I discuss the properties that arise from designing the same API in two different design styles:
        <ul>
            <li>the conventional style, which I call "OpenAPI" style</li>
            <li>a style that applies the REST constraints more strictly, the "hypermedia" style</li>
        </ul>

            In this talk, based on Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's book about the human brain's two modes of thinking,
            I discuss how they influence programming practice.
            Through code examples, I then propose strategies to improve your programming by taking advantage of each of
            modes.

            This was a presentation for the local tech community about often misunderstood aspects of REST API design,
            as well as a few patterns and ideas I've come up with while designing and implementing.

            This is a presentation I made for the Electrical Engineering Days at Instituto Superior Técnico.
            It presented my professional experience thus far and my views on how electrical engineering graduates fit
            into the labor market and the kinds of questions one could ask when trying to choose a job.
